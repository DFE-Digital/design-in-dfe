# Interaction design


The purpose of interaction design is to design user interfaces and the interactions between the user and a service. Interaction design is applicable throughout the agile delivery phases: Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live.

Additionally, interaction designers work on legacy services and rolling out changes to ensure DfE's services are consistent and meet current standards and regulations.

## Standards and guidelines

By using these standards and guidelines we ensure design services that:

- meet the [Service Standard in DfE]()
- meet current web guidelines outlined in [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) as applied through the [public sector accessibility regulations]().
- meet user and organisational needs
- are simple and intuitive to use
- work in a way that is familiar
- require the minimum possible steps to complete
- are consistent throughout
- are usable by everyone, equally
