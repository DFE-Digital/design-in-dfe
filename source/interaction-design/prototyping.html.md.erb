# Prototyping

We design and build prototypes to test solutions to problems. 

Prototypes can be simple wireframe sketches, mockups through to low-code clickable prototypes using the GOV.UK prototype kit. 

> You can read more about prototyping and the differences between <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-prototype-hi-lo-fidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high and low fidelity prototypes</a> on the Nielsen Normal Group (NNG) website.

## How we do prototyping in DfE

We use differnet approaches to prototyping, depending on the audience, the complexity or what we want to test and find out. This means we could:

- test simple sketches with pen and paper 
- create realistic mockups and simple user journeys using <a href="https://figma.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma</a> 
- build clickable prototypes using the <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a> which look and behave like real digital services

### Templates and resources for design tools

To make wireframing and no-code prototyping easier, there are several templates and libraries available to use.

<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/NWuFffKvPQhl3aJ9nKU0p3/GOV.UK-Design-System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Design System Figma Library</a> - Library of up to date design system componenets, styles and patterns to use in Figma design files.

<a href="https://github.com/dwp/sketch_wireframing_kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sketch wireframing kit</a> for use in Sketch (Mac only).

<a href="https://github.com/alirawashdeh/govuk-userflow-icons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SVG user flow icons</a> SVG graphics of desktop and mobile screens for quick journey mapping or user flow diagrams.

## Using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit

Using the kit means you can build prototypes that look like a real GOV.UK service. This helps to make it easier to test for usability issues and get feedback on how the service might perform if it were a real service. 

The kit is used across Government and supported thorugh the cross-gov <a href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/archives/C0647LW4R"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> #prototype-kit</a> Slack channel. 

There are tutorials and example code on the prototype kit website and you can make use of components and patterns from the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Design System</a> by copying HTML or Nunjucks code snippets into your prototype.

To be able to use the prototype kit, you'll need to ensure your device has the following software installed:

<ul class="govuk-list">
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a> - This is a code editor that enables you to make changes and run the kit as a website on your device.</li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.JS (LTS Version)</a> - Node is a Javascript based framework for building websites and applications.</li>
<li>If on a Windows device, you'll need to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git Bash</a></li>
</ul>

### Branding your prototype

If your prototype is not intended for publishing to GOV.UK or service.gov.uk you should follow the <a href="/standards/branding.html#branding-your-service.html">branding your service</a> guidance so that you do not cause confusion with your users.


### Testing your prototype with users

Depending on what testing you plan to do with users, you might want to run your prototype as a website, rather than on your local device.

We use <a href="https://www.heroku.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku</a> to host prototypes and this is free for basic usage and sufficient for most prototype testing. You'll need to create an account using your DfE email address.

You'll also need a <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">GitHub</a> account to store your code and enable it to be deployed to Heroku. 

Prototypes should be created in the GitHub DFE-Digital organisation, clearly identifying them as a prototype. You can request access to GitHub through <a href="https://sites.google.com/digital.education.gov.uk/digitaltools/home?authuser=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" >Digital Tools support</a>.

> Full instructions on how to set up a Heroku account and deploy your prototype can be found on the <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku"  target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">publishing to Heroku guidance</a> on the GOV.UK Design System.
