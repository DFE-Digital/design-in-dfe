# Preparing for assessment

To have a successful assessment, you will need to show:

* what you have done, this could include:

  - mapping the user journeys in discovery
  - creating design options to test in alpha
  - moving through design iterations in beta. 

* how the product will meet user needs and business needs

  - the outcomes and how the product will deliver against these outcomes, in a sustainable and efficient way. As content designers, we identify the most efficient and effective way to deliver the right information at the right time in a way that users need it. This design must also be sustainable and cost efficient to answer both business requirements and user needs.



## Talk about your service

During your assessment, tell the story about what you have done, instead of ticking off the standards one-by-one. Share what you have learnt and what you recommend for the next stage. 

To prepare for this, look at the checklists for each stage to see if your team is we meeting the standards. 

If your team is not meeting the standards, explain why. You should always present your evidence and recommendations clearly, even if this means your product may not move to the next stage.

All digital products with interactive or bespoke design should have some form of quality assurance. If your product is non-transactional (ie it does not transfer data), then it will only need a peer review, rather than an assessment.
