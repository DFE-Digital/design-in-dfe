# Agile content design

## Working in an agile team

Every product or service can vary, as can the team that delivers each stage. 

As a content designer, the following information give an idea of what you should be focusing on at each stage.

[Guide to agile delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery).


## During discovery

Learn about your users, your subject and existing content by: 

* finding the words people use (Google Analytics, Adwords and Trends, online forums, social media) 
* attending user research (listen to user research sessions, meet users, observe how they interact with current services) 
* finding gaps or problems with existing content (GOV.UK Feedex, helpline data and other existing feedback) 
* building your knowledge of the subject and understand the policy intent (work with stakeholders, policy and subject matter experts) 
* reviewing how existing content addresses user needs (GOV.UK, other online information, outbound letters and emails) 
* helping your team define their focus (write problem statements, mission statements and service descriptions) 


## During alpha

Build prototypes, design and iterate content by: 
* creating and updating prototypes with other UCD team members (using Figma, GOV.UK prototype kit, Visual studio code, Heroku and Git)
* writing and testing letters, text messages, emails and other notifications
* following GOV.UK and DfE design patterns and styles (share new patterns and research with other designers in DfE and across government) 
* working with the [digital communications team](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-publish-gov-uk.aspx) - DfE’s GOV.UK content team
* designing GOV.UK start and done pages and testing with users 
* testing GOV.UK content with users to cover the whole journey 
* working with legal and security to understand constraints on content 
* sharing content and research for GOV.UK start, done and guidance pages helping business analysts and product owners to write clear user stories

## During private beta

Design the content for your first release by: 
* designing error and validation messages 
* showing when the online service is unavailable 
* explaining how the service uses cookies and collects personal data 
* writing feedback questions to help the team learn about the user’s experience 
* translating content into Welsh (the Welsh language team can give you this) 
* working with digital communication team at DfE and the CDDO content team on GOV.UK start, done and guidance pages (for launch of public beta) 
* writing metadata descriptions and keywords to help users find the right service and improve search engine rankings 
* iterating content based on feedback from users, design hypotheses and analytics
* helping your team to name the service 

## Live
You should continue to iterate the service content by using feedback and analytics to inform changes or discover new user needs to explore.

You should regularly review and audit the content to ensure it remains relevant, up to date and continues to meet users’ needs.
