# Quality checks
You should have an agreed and documented quality checking process. 

Your process should:

- be appropriate for your service
- take into account different levels of changes - typo, minor content update, policy change
- include how and when you conduct activities such as (more detail in other resources section): 
  - 2i and peer reviews
  - fact checking
  - policy sign-off
  - communications

You should conduct your final quality checks on a preview of the content as it would appear once published. 


# Example

The digital communications team (often referred to as DCT or digi comms) is an internal team that manage DfE’s content on GOV.UK. They support product teams with updates to GOV.UK content, start pages for services and campaign sites.
