# Content design

Content design packages up the right information in a way that users understand at the right time. It can be applied to a transaction, product or single piece of content that stretches across digital and offline channels. 

A content designer makes things easier for people to understand and use. They use data, research and testing to understand what people need and then design content to meet those needs.
